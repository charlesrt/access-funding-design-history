## The problem

We saw through research that most applications used open-ended questions resulting in long and unstructured responses that contained more information than required. 

## What we did
By identifying pattens for how we ask questions, we were able to collect data based on what the department needed to make a decision, in a structured and consistent way.

## Question pattens

### 1. Structured logic

Providing a specific set of responses to choose from enables applicants to answer the question in way assessors are expecting. Enabling assessment of responses to be comparable and consistent across all applications received. In also stops applicants feeling like they need to provide more information than is necessary.

### 2. Numerical/tabular data

We saw through research that lots of financial data was provided through spreadsheets in a variety of different formats. This resulted in assessors not knowing where to look to find the specific information they needed to assess. 

Asking for specific numerical data when needed keeps applicants informed on what data to provide. This enables assessors to compare applications in an equitable way avoid bias based on the "quality" of spreadsheet presentation.

### 3. Formatted question groups

By formatting questions as collective groups, applicants have clarity on the relationship between questions and know what information they need to provide that connects them.

Sometimes applicants may need to provide multiple responses to groups. By enabling applicants to 'add another' we avoid guessing how much information an applicant may need to provide.

### 4. Hard evidence
Historically, we saw through research that some application consisted of multiple unstructured documents submitted. Assessors didn't know where to look to find specific information pertaining to the criteria they needed to assess. Some applicants also provided more documentation that assessors had time to read through. 

Whilst most information could be obtained through structured question pattens, we identified there was a need to documents to still be provided in certain circumstances, such as providing hard evidence. 

If an applicants needs to provide hard evidence, such as a photograph, or a letter of endorsement, we enable them to upload a specific document. This type of data cannot be provided in any other way.

### 5. Narrative
The question patterns identified help applicants know what specific tangible data they need to provide. It also enabled consistent and equitable assessment. However, on occasion, it is still necessary for applicants to add more detail that clarifies the narrative of their responses. This gives assessors a big-picture view and helps to tell the story of their response. 

When using an open-ended format, it is important to apply an appropriate word limit.
