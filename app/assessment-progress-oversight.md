## The problem

Having a live view of assessment, and the progress that is being made is challenge for fund teams. Currently, tracker spreadsheets are used which are irregularly updated by assessors (typically at the end of each day), to give an indication of which assessments are completed and which are in progress. When multiple types of assessors are involved in assessment (i.e Commercial Grants Cell or Other Government Departments), this can also create bottlenecks that are hard for assessment leads to identify and push progress on. 

## What we did

We evaluated existing assessment tracking documentation to understand how and why they are being used and used this to fuel conversations with assessment teams to understand the value of these processes as well as the challenges. This allowed us to mock up different prototypes that represented alternative ways for live assessment data to be visualised within our tool, without the requirement of tracking spreadsheets. 

We then conducted 1:1 research sessions with members of the Assessment Hub as well as Assessment Leads, Commerical Grants Cell Assessors and Fund Delivery Teams to understand how these different visual prompts felt for them. 

## Evidence

From testing different variations of a lead assessor dashboard, we were able to collect feedback on different features. The following features were deemed to be a priority from fund teams:

1. Done vs Not Done live statistics
2. Progress bars
3. Search filters
4. Scores
5. Columns with key application data such as 'funding value'
6. Deadlines
7. Flagged assessments

## Decisions

We learned that all of these elements needed to be displayed clearly for an overall view of assessment as well as against all ongoing and upcoming assessments. The decision was taken to ensure all of this could be displayed and was continually tested until fund teams were satisfied with the displayed. Over time, these have continued to be iterated and improved to meet the needs of funds in a universal way. 

We used the same pattern as displaying data for live applications, to surface the progress of assessments for Lead Assessors to track.

In addition to high-level data for reporting, the assessment team is also able to see the assessment status of any application, including a percentage of how complete assessment is, based on the number of sub-criteria scored. This provides a rich picture of progress without the need for manual updates to made daily.
