## The problem
We saw that fund teams would have to manually track the number of applications based on those submitted via email, or uploaded to sharepoint. Funds had no way of monitoring in-progress applications as these were all being prepared offline. This led to fund teams having to estimate what the final number of submitted applications would be so they could staff an assessment team appropriately.

## What we did
With applications being prepared in our products over time, we had the same data of how many applications had been submitted. We also had the data of how many applications had been started but not yet submitted. By surfacing this data in real time, fund teams are to see a live view and more accurate figures of how many applications they can expect to assess.

## Decisions
We implemented a dashboard that displays the same data teams were manually trying to track previously as well as additional data they needed.

This data is presented within the assessment product, alongside current assessment progress. Fund teams are able to access this data as and when required, without the need for manual data gathering.
