## The problem

Applying for funding is a 'whole-team' collaborative effort. If our products don't fit into the established workflow of teams, they could become a barrier to entry.

## What we did
Rather than add full-featured collaborative functionality to Access Funding, we made sure the technical implementation of the form allows for simple copy and paste. 

We also balanced our need for simple, easy to read answers with preserving the formatting in which an applicant may have structured their response (such as italics, bold, bullets).

## Evidence

Applicants told us:
- Fund applications are rarely a one person effort, instead they are collaborative, with many individuals contributing, reviewing and, signing off information to be included
- Standard collaborative applications such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word are the tools most widely used for collating and reviewing answers from colleagues

## Decisions
We don't intend for Access Funding to replace Google Docs or Microsoft Word as the tool for information collation, instead we ensure it supports the use of these tools by not introducing any unnecessary friction to moving content to Access Funding.
