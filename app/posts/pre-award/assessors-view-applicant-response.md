## The problem
Traditionally, it was not necessarily the case that assessors could see the full view of an applicants response in a single place. Documents could be stored in Sharepoint folders and there could be multiple of them, meaning assessors would continually be using different tabs and windows when assessing an application. Navigation was difficult and increased the risk of content being missed, as well as breaking up the assessment flow. 

## What we did
We recognised the need for assessors to be able to view all content in a single place, easily navigate between different responses and ensure multiple tabs and windows were not required to view and assess uploaded content. 
We worked with assessors and colleagues from the Commercial Grants Team to explore different variations of how this content could look. Supported by best practice and GDS guidelines, we were able to create a series of accessible and clear options to do this. Our research teams, alongside our Interaction and Content designers undertook usability testing on the different options to establish which designs worked best for assessment.
The positive insights from this work were captured, designs were iterated and final concepts were developed. 

## Evidence
The research insights from testing showed us that:
1. Assessors want to be able to see a full response to each question on a single page or screen
2. It is important for assessors that the question being asked for each response is clearly visible
3. If there are attachments or documents, they are able to be opened within the tool, rather than being opened in a separate screen, window or tab
4. Being able to see guidance alongside a response helps with the evaluation process 
5. Being able to easily navigate between questions is important to support evaluation
6. Being able to easily see applicant responses that lend to the context of the bid, such as 'project overviews' are really helpful when you arent assessing a full bid and just one or two criteria

## Decisions
Features to support the key insights found were taken forward into development. All bid responses are available to assessors and they can see a top-line of all un-scored questions for every application. 

Within the assessment tool, all content per question is clearly displayed and documents which have been uploaded are displayed in-tool with the question rather than in different locations. Guidance is also provided to assessors within each question they are assessing.
