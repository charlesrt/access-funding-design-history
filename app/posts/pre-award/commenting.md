## The problem
Through research, we identified that assessors would using word documents as they assessed applications, in order to record their commentary as they reviewed the response. 

Assessors would also need to invite third-party specialists to comment on certain sections of responses they might specialise in. For example, Scottish Government would be invited to comment by exception on funding applications in Scotland. Another example, The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport would be invited to comment on funding applications related to sporting facilities. 

## What we did
We enabled comments to be added by any users invited to the product. Comments could be left against specific sections of sub-criteria, both by assessors and third-parties. 

These comments would then be displayed at the point of scoring so they could be considered in the final decision. 

## Decisions
Due to delivery constraints, we weren't able to implement everything we designed. This included the ability for users to edit and delete comments. We know, from research, that editing comments is important, especially in the case of errors and the team will look to implement this in the future. 

We didn't add an explicit word limit to comments, so as not to constrain assessors and third-parties as any word limit would have been a guess. There is a technical word limit as a result of the database which is ~10,000 characters. From what we've observed, users are not at risk of exceeding that limit.
