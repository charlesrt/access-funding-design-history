## The problem
Due to the length of some fund applications, we observed that applicants would go through all the questions first to understand what's asked of them so they can prepare.

## What we did
At the start of every section, we introduced an, 'In this section, we'll ask about' page which lists all the data points the questions in that section would cover. 

## Decisions
For consistency we added this at the beginning of every section, even if that section only asks for one thing. This meant that applicants would become familiar with the pattern and could trust they'd prepared what they needed before starting a section. 

If a data point was conditional — meaning based on how earlier questions are answered, the applicant might not be asked certain others — we added '(if applicable)' so applicants aren't concerned if they don't have something.
