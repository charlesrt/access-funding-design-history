## The problem
Previously, many applications for funds were received through tools such as Citizen Space or MS Forms and attachments would be sent into a mailbox. Due to the manual nature of pairing an application form with the relevant documents that had been sent in, applicants were at risk of manual error causing some of their files to not be attached to their application forms. 

There were instances where applicants would receive a rejection for their bid because they did not provide certain documentation or evidence when they had, it had just been lost along the way. 

## What we did
We curated a set of design principles which ensured that:
1. All question responses would be hosted in the same application tool, and that tool would map directly to the assessment tool
2. All uploads of documents would directly be uploaded into the tool, along with visual confirmation that the document had been successfully uploaded
3. We sent an email confirmation to all applicants to reassure them that all their data had been received

## Evidence
We tested the application forms based on these principles and outputs with previous applicants who had experienced the alternative methods of data submission such as Citizen Space, MS Forms or Email. The results of testing were incredibly positive. All previous applicants were incredibly happy with these new principles and methods, particularly regarding the confirmation of uploaded documentation and the follow up email which provided them with a copy of their submission for their reference.
