## The problem
Funds with similar criteria ask questions differently, meaning:
- there is little ability to share and learn from other funds' experience
- there's no mechanism for reusing other funds' work, so the amount of work needed to deliver a fund is increased
- the ability to collect, compare and reuse data is limited, risking opportunities for efficiencies, innovation and insights.

## What we did
We looked at several different funds that had already been delivered (Levelling Up Fund, Community Ownership Fund Round 1) to see if we could spot opportunities for reuse, and found some, but discovered that the problem needed to be addressed further upstream when funds are in their design stage, or it would be difficult to convince funds the effort to reuse questions was worth it.

We worked with the Community Ownership Fund Round 2 to figure out a starting point that worked for them, then the Night Shelter Transformation Fund, the Children and Young Peoples Resettlement fund, and the Digital Planning Funds. Throughout these engagements as part of our Question Protocol Workshops we used the previous funds as a best practice 'library' of questions and patterns to meet the needs of the new fund, ensuring each fund was able to benefit from the experience and findings of previous funds.

## Future improvements
The 'library' of best practice is current conceptual and doesn't exist anywhere outside instances of funds, this needs to be addressed with a design and development task to figure out how and where to store questions, patterns and criteria, so they can be easily found and used by future funding teams.

Any work to allow applicants to reuse answers from other funding applications will depend on this work being progressed (eg asking organisation contact details consistently across all funds).

## Evidence
We heard from fund teams: 
- they used previous funds' experiences sporadically, and this was dependant on the team's social network within the department.
- there was no 'one place' to go to learn how to make choices about the fund criteria or application questions
- inconsistent processes surrounding question development meant funds were re-inventing the wheel with every new fund they worked on

We heard from applicants: 
- asking the same questions in different funds was frustrating, especially if they applied for a lot of funds, it was desirable to have the tool remember the answers.
- asking for the same data across different funds in different ways is also frustrating because their answers need to be re-developed each time they apply for a new fund

We heard from assessors: 
- in the assessment hub that more consistency in how different funds ask questions would be beneficial in reducing training time and confusion between funds.
- consistent ways of asking for data also means guidance for assessment could also remain consistent

## Decisions
Working with funds iteratively through the Questions Protocol workshops is a good way to deliver some elements of reusability at this stage of the project. This process supports DLUHC funds in taking a 'data first' approach and ensuring they capture the right data, and only the necessary data within each application.

In the future this will need re-examining, as we anticipate this will become less suitable as we scale the service to more funds.
