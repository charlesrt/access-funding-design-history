## The problem
Assessors were using separate word documents to store their comments because there have been previous experiences with tools like Delta losing work that was done previously by assessors. Moreover, assessors would have to write a justification for a score, and their comments relative to the different questions within a sub-criteria would be in separate places making the justification for scoring hard to write. 

Also if some questions required commentary from OGDs, it would be hard to keep track of that alongside the assessors own comments when making their final scores and justifications. 

## What we did
We recognised that it was necessary to visibly display the comments written against each question within a sub-criteria on the page where scoring and justification took place. 

Our interaction and content designers worked collaboratively with the research team to develop a series of different ways that question specific comments could be displayed on the scoring and justification page. It was important for us to understand what degree of context was needed against these comments and what information needed to be displayed ie questions, name of commenter, time of comment etc. 

We developed a series of prototypes to be tested with assessors within Assessment Hub and the Commercial Grants Cell to gather their feedback.
