## The problem
If a prospectus isn't well understood by an applicant, their experience completing an application will be much worse and they will provide more information than required to meet unclear criteria.

A prospectus details everything an applicant might need to know about a fund before applying, including what criteria will assessed. These often used a lot of technical language and due to their complexity could be hard to navigate, especially when preparing an application in a separate document.

## What we did
We used content design best practices to work with fund teams in the creation of their prospectuses and identified opportunities to include contextual guidance in-application. By using plain language that is easy to understand and accessible, we're supporting applicant's understanding of fund eligibility and what information is expected in their responses. This reduces confusion and errors in the application process, leading to more accurate and complete applications. It also opens funding, that previously may have favoured those who could afford expert support, to a diverse range of applicants.

## Decisions

It's important that we work with fund teams as early as possible so we can support the creation of prospectuses and guidance. If funds come to us too late, after a prospectus has already been created and published it can be trickier to influence.
