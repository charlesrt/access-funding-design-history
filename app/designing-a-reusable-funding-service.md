### 1. Content

**Use of guidance and question content design, plain language, accessible, etc**

In order to achieve reusability in a funding service, it is important to consider the content of the application process. This includes providing clear guidance and question content that is designed to be easy to understand, written in plain language, and accessible to all users.

By providing clear and concise guidance, users can better understand the purpose of the fund and what information is required to apply. This approach helps to reduce confusion and errors in the application process, leading to more accurate and complete applications.

Additionally, providing guidance and content that is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities, helps to ensure that the application process is inclusive and meets the needs of a diverse user base. This approach not only benefits users, but also improves the overall quality of the applications received.

### 2. Questions

**Building a library of reusable questions, where we've asked for the same data in the same way already**

One of the most effective ways to achieve reusability in a funding service is to build a library of reusable questions. By doing this, we can reduce the time and effort required for development and ensure consistency in the data collected across different funds.

Building a library of reusable questions involves identifying common data requirements across different funds and creating a set of questions that can be used across all funds. This approach reduces the need to create new questions from scratch for each fund, saving time and reducing the potential for errors.

In addition, reusing questions across different funds ensures that the data collected is consistent, making it easier to compare and assess different applications. This approach also makes it easier for users to complete the application process, as they are not required to provide the same information in different ways for different funds.

### 3. Patterns for collecting data

**A layer of patterns for collecting specific types of data**

In addition to building a library of reusable questions, it is also important to identify patterns for collecting specific types of data. By using patterns that are tailored to the specific types of data needed for each fund, we can ensure consistency in the data collected and reduce the time and effort required for development. These patterns can include numerical inputs, checkboxes, file uploads, and other types of input fields that are commonly used in the application process.

By identifying patterns for collecting data, we can also ensure that the data collected is accurate and relevant to the fund being applied for. This approach reduces the likelihood of errors and ensures that the right data is collected for each fund.

### 4. Design language

**Using GOV.UK style and components**

To achieve reusability in a funding service, it is important to use a consistent design language and components. By using the GOV.UK style and components, we can ensure consistency in the presentation of the service, making it easier for users to navigate and complete the application process.

Using a consistent design language and components also reduces the time and effort required for development. By reusing design components, such as buttons, forms, and layouts, we can reduce the need for manual coding and ensure consistency in the design of the service.

### 5. Functions

**Consistent processes and functions, such as scoring models, commenting, flagging and quality assurance**

Another important aspect of achieving reusability in a funding service is to develop consistent processes and functions. This includes developing scoring models, commenting systems, flagging systems, and quality assurance processes that can be reused across different funds.

By developing consistent processes and functions, we can ensure that the assessment process is fair and consistent across different funds. This approach reduces the potential for bias and errors in the assessment process, leading to more accurate and equitable funding decisions.

### 6. Page templates

**Consistent and repeatable page templates using GOV.UK Design System and code**

Consistency is key when it comes to user experience, and that's where page templates come in. By using consistent and repeatable page templates, users can easily navigate the site and know what to expect from each page. This means using the GOV.UK Design System and code to create page templates that are familiar to users and follow established design patterns.

Using the GOV.UK Design System also ensures that pages are accessible and meet government accessibility guidelines. This means that users of all abilities can use the service, improving the user experience for everyone. By building these templates with reusable code, they can be easily reused and modified for different funds or rounds.

### 7. Code

**Reusable blocks of code that can be configurable without the need for manual creation every time**

Reusability is also important when it comes to the code itself. By creating reusable blocks of code, developers can save time and effort when building new features or modifying existing ones. This also helps ensure consistency across the site and reduces the risk of errors or bugs.

Using configurable code also means that developers can easily modify the code to suit different needs without having to manually create new code every time. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the code.

### 8. Platform

**Able to create environments for funds in parallel**

Finally, the platform itself needs to be designed with reusability in mind. This means creating an infrastructure that can support multiple funds and rounds in parallel, without having to create a new environment every time. By doing this, the service can scale more easily and support more funds and rounds without requiring significant manual effort.

This also means considering how data is stored and managed, and ensuring that it can be easily accessed and reused for different funds and rounds. By designing the platform with reusability in mind, the service can be more efficient, flexible and adaptable to changing needs over time.

## Building a sustainable future for funding services through reusability and user-centric design

To deliver funds more efficiently and effectively, reusability is essential. Adopting a **reusability-driven design** approach can help scale the process and significantly reduce the time and effort required to launch new funds in a consistent and reliable way. It can improve the accessibility and experience for applicants whilst enabling assessors to make accurate and equitable decisions, ultimately contributing to the success of delivering funding services in the department.
