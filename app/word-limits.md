## The problem
When we don't limit the amount of information applicants are expected to provide they are more likely to over-provide information. This creates inefficiencies for applicants (working harder and longer than needed) and assessors (reading detailed answers).

## What we did
We added word limits to all questions as standard and varied these limits depending on how much the answer contributed to the criteria score. A low criteria weighted question should have a smaller word limit and a high weighted question should require a more detailed answer.

We made UI changes to clearly indicate the word limit, updating as more words are added and prevent submissions that exceed it.

## Decisions
This has become part of our fund onboarding process and question protocol workshops, working with fund teams to match detail expected with the importance of the question per the criteria
