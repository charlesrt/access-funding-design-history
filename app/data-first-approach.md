## The problem
Questions weren't giving applicants the best chance of meeting the criteria because they weren't written in a structured way, resulting in inefficiencies in assessment and wasted effort on behalf of applicants.

## What we did
Questions were being asked of candidates that:
- Weren't being used directly for decision making
- Were open and vague, encouraging the applicant to give long and unfocused answers
- Didn't result in the right kind of answer from the candidate, leading to assessors looking in other answers for details, introducing unfairness

We interviewed assessors and applicants about the performance of questions, answers and what effects different types of questions had on the performance of assessment.

We designed a structured process for writing questions which we delivered in Question Protocol Workshops with funding teams.

Through Question Protocol Workshops we encouraged funding teams to think about the questions in a different way. Rather than starting with a question, starting with the smallest data point they need to make a decision according to the assessment criteria.

This changed the approach from 'what question do we need ask' to 'what information do we need to assess if this application meets the this criteria' allowing fund teams to create questions that are focused and necessary for applicants, and can be assessed directly against the criteria in decision making.

## Evidence
We were told in assessor interviews data was being picked from other answers because the candidate had not answered a question correctly. We also heard from applicants that if a question was vague or unclear they would over-answer the question in the hope it would give them a better chance of meeting the criteria
