Six principles proven to make your fund perform

## 1. Make the process simple

If you make applying for funds simple, more people will submit good applications, and money will go to the people and places that need it.

## 2. Make eligibility clear

If applicants don’t know if they’re eligible up front, people's time and resource will be wasted.

## 3. Make the process transparent

It’s important that the user can complete the task with minimal support and get help when they need it.

Make sure that everyone can use our service.

## 4. Be inclusive

Set expectations about how the application process works and how long things might take.

## 5. Only ask for the information you need

Do not waste people's time. Only ask for the information you actually need, and only ask for it once.

## 6. Be consistent

Share, ask for and present information in the same way every time to avoid confusion and build trust.
